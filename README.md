## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 Weekend Project at Skill Distillery

### Overview:

This program is designed to simulate a game of Blackjack using Object-Oriented Programming. The application can accommodate one player.

### How to run:

First, the user enters their menu selection. The user can choose to:
1. Play Blackjack
2. Quit

Blackjack starts the game with the player playing against the dealer. The dealer deals cards to the player and the dealerâ€™s hand.

Game table information to know:
1. Card point values: Aces will have a value of 11, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are each worth 10 points, and all other cards are face value.
2. The goal is to get 21 points or be the closest to 21 without going over.
3. We will be playing with one deck of 52 cards.
4. The dealer will let you know when starting a new deck.

While playing, the player will have the option to hit, be given another card, or stay. The program will then calculate if the player will be asked again to hit or stay, or if there is a winner.

The player will be asked if they want to play again at the end of every round. If they play again, they will play with the same deck unless there are fewer than 13 cards left at the end of the prior game.

### Technologies used:

Java, Eclipse, Atom, Git, and Github.

### Topics implemented:

Java Libraries: ArrayList, List, enumerators, collections, and handling exceptions with try/catch.

Object-Oriented Programming in Java: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation, Object initiation, and  Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams.

Java Fundamentals of Programming: Iteration, recursion, for loops, advanced for loops, if/else if/else statements, and a switch statement.

### Lessons learned:

This project helped me better grasp the capabilities of Object-Oriented Programming by allowing me to better learn how to:
1. Build classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
2. Build classes whose fields are Objects.
3. Practice writing methods.
3. Use collection types to organize and manage data.
4. Use conditionals to create game logic.
5. Use Eclipse's debugging features.
